# Interstellar Probe Trajectory Using PyKep
This repository contains a Lambert solver for an Interstellar Probe to the heliopause, which I did as my Master's thesis using PyKep. It has an Earth-Jupiter, Jupiter-Heliopause, and Earth-Venus, Venus-Jupiter, Jupiter-Heliopause Lambert solver. In addition to this, it also has the Pygmo validation code and a patched Earth-Venus-Jupiter trajectory in GMAT with snippets of Earth-Jupiter trajectories.
